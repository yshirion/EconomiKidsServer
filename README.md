# EconomiKidsServer

This is app for manage the money of kids, and to educate them to manage right their money by themselves.
In app you log up your family as a main account, when the parent (now only one) is the user that manage this account. Then, the children could create their own account, under the main account. 
The parent can see their state, add or subtract money from their account, enter their money to investment, and give them  a loan. In addition, he can text to children message and get from them too.
The children can ask from parent to expense money or to get a loan (now, they can to do it themselves).

For this app you should have on your computer â€“ 
-	Java SDK version 8 and up.
-	'Android Studio', to run the client side (the real app).
-	Some IDE that is possible to run Java language with it, such as 'Intellij' or eclipse (for server).
-	MySQL for database.
This is Android application, so:
If you want to run this app on your phone, you can do it with device support android 11+, and connect to 'Android Studio' with same wifi (you need the 'developer option).
Soon, with help of Gad, I hope that it will possible to download this app on your phone without connection to computer.

Enjoy,
Yechiel Shirion.
